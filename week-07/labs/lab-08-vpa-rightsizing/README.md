# Lab 8: Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) — Right-Sizing Resource Requests

**Time:** 25-30 minutes  
**Objective:** Use VPA to observe and apply right-sized CPU/memory requests based on actual workload behavior

---

## The Story

In Lab 5 you set up HPA to scale out — more replicas when CPU climbs. But HPA assumes your resource *requests* are already accurate. If Jerry's app has `requests: cpu: 1000m` and it actually uses 80m at peak, the scheduler reserves 12.5x the CPU it needs. On a 10-node cluster that's real money and real placement inefficiency.

VPA watches your pods over time and tells you — or automatically applies — better-fit requests and limits. On the CKA exam you're expected to know what VPA is, how it differs from HPA, and how to read its recommendations.

---

## Background: Vertical Rightsizing and Disruption Tradeoffs

VPA continuously compares observed container usage against declared requests and limits, then produces bounded recommendations. Unlike HPA, VPA tuning often requires pod recreation to apply changes, so disruption policy and rollout timing matter. In practice, teams start in recommendation mode and promote changes deliberately.

---

## VPA vs HPA — Quick Model

| | HPA | VPA |
|---|---|---|
| What it changes | `spec.replicas` | `resources.requests` and `limits` per container |
| Responds to | Aggregate utilization across replicas | Per-pod utilization vs requests ratio |
| Scaling axis | Horizontal (more pods) | Vertical (bigger/smaller pods) |
| Pod restart required | No | Yes — VPA applies changes by evicting and recreating pods |
| Use together? | Yes, but don't let both control CPU — use VPA for memory, HPA for CPU |

---

## Part 1: Install VPA

VPA is not included in kind by default. Install it from the official repo:

```bash
# Clone the autoscaler repo (VPA lives here)
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler.git --depth 1
cd autoscaler/vertical-pod-autoscaler

# Install VPA components
./hack/vpa-up.sh

# Verify the three VPA components are running
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep vpa
```

You should see three pods:
- `vpa-recommender` — watches actual usage and generates recommendations
- `vpa-updater` — evicts pods when recommendations differ significantly from current requests
- `vpa-admission-controller` — rewrites pod specs at admission time if updateMode is `Auto`

---

## Part 2: Deploy an Under-Resourced App

Create a deployment with intentionally wrong resource requests — the kind of thing Jerry would commit:

```yaml
# deploy-overprovisioned.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: jerry-overprovisioned
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: jerry-overprovisioned
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: jerry-overprovisioned
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: nginx:1.25-alpine
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 500m        # Jerry's guess — probably too high
            memory: 256Mi    # Jerry's guess — probably too high
          limits:
            cpu: 1000m
            memory: 512Mi
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy-overprovisioned.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/jerry-overprovisioned
```

---

## Part 3: Create a VPA Object in Recommendation Mode

Create a VPA targeting the deployment. Start in `Off` mode — this means VPA only recommends, it never touches your pods:

```yaml
# vpa-recommend.yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: jerry-vpa
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: jerry-overprovisioned
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Off"    # Recommend only — do not evict or mutate pods
  resourcePolicy:
    containerPolicies:
    - containerName: app
      minAllowed:
        cpu: 10m
        memory: 32Mi
      maxAllowed:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 1Gi
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f vpa-recommend.yaml
```

VPA needs time to gather metrics. Wait a few minutes, then check recommendations:

```bash
kubectl describe vpa jerry-vpa
```

Look for the `Status.Recommendation` section. You'll see `Lower Bound`, `Target`, `Upper Bound`, and `Uncapped Target` for each container.

Explore the VPA spec to understand all fields:

```bash
kubectl explain vpa.spec
kubectl explain vpa.spec.updatePolicy
kubectl explain vpa.spec.resourcePolicy.containerPolicies
```

---

## Part 4: Generate Some Load to Shape the Recommendation

Run a brief load test so VPA has more signal to work with:

```bash
# Port-forward the app
kubectl port-forward deployment/jerry-overprovisioned 8080:80 &

# Generate requests for 60 seconds
for i in $(seq 1 300); do curl -s http://localhost:8080 > /dev/null; sleep 0.2; done

# Kill port-forward
kill %1
```

After another 2-3 minutes, recheck the VPA recommendation:

```bash
kubectl describe vpa jerry-vpa
```

Compare the `Target` recommendation to Jerry's original `500m / 256Mi` requests.

---

## Part 5: Understand Update Modes

VPA has four `updateMode` values — knowing these is exam-relevant:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `Off` | Recommendations only. Never modifies pods. |
| `Initial` | Applies recommendations only to *new* pods at creation. Never evicts running pods. |
| `Recreate` | Evicts pods and applies recommendations when the pod's current requests differ significantly from recommendation. |
| `Auto` | Combination of `Initial` + `Recreate`. Current default "full auto" mode. |

For production, `Off` or `Initial` are safest starting points. `Auto` in a cluster with no PodDisruptionBudgets is aggressive.

---

## Part 6: Apply Recommendations Manually (Off Mode Workflow)

Since you're in `Off` mode, you control when changes land. Read the recommendation and apply it yourself:

```bash
# Get the target recommendation
kubectl get vpa jerry-vpa -o jsonpath='{.status.recommendation.containerRecommendations[0].target}'
```

Update the deployment with the recommended values:

```bash
kubectl patch deployment jerry-overprovisioned -p='{
  "spec": {
    "template": {
      "spec": {
        "containers": [{
          "name": "app",
          "resources": {
            "requests": {
              "cpu": "<VPA target cpu>",
              "memory": "<VPA target memory>"
            }
          }
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Verify the rollout applied cleanly:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/jerry-overprovisioned
kubectl describe deployment jerry-overprovisioned | grep -A6 Requests
```

---

## HPA + VPA Together — The Safe Pattern

If you're using both on the same deployment:

- Let HPA own CPU scaling (replica count based on CPU utilization)
- Let VPA own memory right-sizing (`resourcePolicy` to exclude CPU from VPA control)
- Set VPA updateMode to `Off` or `Initial` and manually review before applying

Exclude CPU from VPA recommendations:

```yaml
resourcePolicy:
  containerPolicies:
  - containerName: app
    controlledResources:
    - memory    # VPA only recommends memory — leave CPU to HPA
```

---

## Discovery Questions

1. You have a pod with `requests.cpu: 500m` and VPA recommends `Target: 80m`. In `Off` mode, does the running pod change? What about a new pod created after you switch to `Initial` mode?

2. VPA evicts a pod to apply new resource requests. What cluster feature prevents VPA from taking down every pod in a deployment simultaneously?

3. Your deployment has 1 replica and VPA is set to `Auto`. VPA wants to right-size resources. What happens to your running pod? Is there any downtime?

4. HPA is scaling your deployment based on CPU. VPA is also running in `Auto` mode and is changing `requests.cpu`. Why might this cause the HPA to make poor decisions, and what would you do about it?

5. `kubectl describe vpa jerry-vpa` shows `Lower Bound`, `Target`, and `Upper Bound`. What is the practical difference between `Target` and `Upper Bound` for a production sizing decision?

---

## Verification Checklist

You are done when:

- VPA components are running in `kube-system`
- `jerry-vpa` shows a non-empty recommendation for the target deployment
- You can explain `Off`, `Initial`, and `Auto` update modes
- You applied a recommendation intentionally and verified rollout success

---

## Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete vpa jerry-vpa
kubectl delete deployment jerry-overprovisioned
cd ../../../..
rm -rf autoscaler
```

---

## Key Takeaways

- VPA right-sizes requests and limits based on observed usage — it doesn't change replica count
- `Off` mode is recommendation-only and is the safest starting point in production
- VPA applies changes by evicting and recreating pods — understand the disruption model
- HPA and VPA can coexist safely if you divide responsibility: HPA for CPU replicas, VPA for memory sizing
- CKA exam expects you to know the difference between HPA and VPA and read VPA recommendation output
